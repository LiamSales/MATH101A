/*You're on the **right track**, Liam â€” this is a solid first attempt at structuring an algebra solver module. You're doing the following right:

---

## âœ… What's Good in Your Code

* **User input is immediately handled** â€” grabbing the equation once as a `String`
* You're **splitting the equation** into `leftSide` and `rightSide` using `substringBefore`/`After`, which is a clean way to isolate both expressions
* You've planned for:

  * **Expression parsing** using regex
  * **Storing terms** with signs, variables, and exponents
  * **Classifying** solutions (identity, conditional, inconsistent)
* Youâ€™re thinking in **terms of math logic**, not just code. Thatâ€™s rare and valuable.

---

## ðŸ”§ What You Can Do Going Forward

Hereâ€™s a practical breakdown of how you can progress â€” step by step:

---

### ðŸ”¸ 1. Normalize the Expression

You want both sides simplified to this form:

```
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
```

**Goal:** Combine like terms and bring everything to one side.

ðŸ‘‰ You'll need:

* A **symbolic parser** that turns `"3x^2 - 2x + 5"` into structured data.

---

### ðŸ”¸ 2. Use Useful Data Structures

Hereâ€™s what will help the most:

#### âœ… `data class Term`

Create something like:

```kotlin
data class Term(val coefficient: Double, val variable: String, val exponent: Int)
```

To store terms like `3x^2`, `-2x`, `+5`.

---

#### âœ… `List<Term>` or `MutableList<Term>`

Once parsed, store your equation as a list of these `Term` objects.

You can use this list to:

* Sort by exponent (highest to lowest)
* Combine like terms
* Check which type of equation it is (linear, quadratic)

---

#### âœ… `Map<String, Double>` for Constants or Grouped Coefficients

You can also group terms by variable and exponent:

```kotlin
Map<String, Double> // key: "x^2", value: coefficient
```

Use this if you want to simplify combining like terms.

---

#### âœ… Regex + String Builders

To **tokenize** the equation, youâ€™ll need:

* Regex to find terms (`Â±number`, optional variable, optional exponent)
* StringBuilder or similar to reconstruct simplified expressions or steps

---

### ðŸ”¸ 3. Equation Type Detection

Once terms are parsed and combined, check:

* If only constants remain (e.g., `0 = 5`) â†’ **Inconsistent**
* If all terms cancel out (`0 = 0`) â†’ **Identity**
* If linear or quadratic remains â†’ **Solve it**

---

### ðŸ”¸ 4. Inequality Support

After youâ€™re done with `=`, upgrade to:

* `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

These can reuse most of your logic, just with added logic for solution ranges:

* e.g., `x^2 - 4 > 0` becomes `(x < -2) âˆª (x > 2)`

---

### ðŸ”¸ 5. Keep Step Tracking

If you want step-by-step output:

* Store each transformation in a `List<String>` as a **solution trace** or `steps: MutableList<String>`

Example:

```text
1. Original: 3x + 6 = 9
2. Subtract 6: 3x = 3
3. Divide by 3: x = 1
```
